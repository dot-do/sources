# O*NET Task Statements Data Source

Task statements describe the specific work activities performed in each occupation.

## Data Schema

### TSV Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| O*NET-SOC Code | string | Occupation code |
| Task ID | integer | Unique task identifier |
| Task | text | Task statement description |
| Task Type | string | Core or supplemental task |
| Incumbents Responding | float | % of workers who perform task |

### Example Rows

```
15-1252.00	1	Analyze user needs and software requirements to determine feasibility of design within time and cost constraints.	Core	92.50
15-1252.00	2	Confer with systems analysts, engineers, programmers and others to design system and to obtain information on project limitations and capabilities.	Core	87.00
```

## Collection Mapping

Maps to: **db/Tasks/{slug}/readme.mdx**

### Slug Generation

```typescript
// Example: Task ID 1 + occupation → "analyze-user-needs-software-requirements"
function generateTaskSlug(taskId: number, task: string): string {
  return task
    .substring(0, 80) // Truncate long statements
    .toLowerCase()
    .replace(/[^a-z0-9\s-]/g, '')
    .replace(/\s+/g, '-')
    .replace(/-+$/, '') // Remove trailing hyphens
}
```

### Frontmatter Structure

```yaml
---
taskId: 1
occupationCode: 15-1252.00
occupationTitle: Software Developers
statement: Analyze user needs and software requirements...
taskType: Core
incumbentsResponding: 92.5
collection: Tasks
source: onet
version: "30.0"
---
```

## Relationships

- **Belongs To**: One occupation (O*NET-SOC Code)
- **Related To**: Skills, abilities, knowledge areas required

## Transform Logic

```typescript
interface TaskRow {
  'O*NET-SOC Code': string
  'Task ID': number
  'Task': string
  'Task Type': string
  'Incumbents Responding': number
}

interface Task {
  taskId: number
  occupationCode: string
  statement: string
  taskType: string
  incumbentsResponding: number
  slug: string
  collection: 'Tasks'
  source: 'onet'
}

function transformTask(row: TaskRow): Task {
  return {
    taskId: row['Task ID'],
    occupationCode: row['O*NET-SOC Code'],
    statement: row['Task'],
    taskType: row['Task Type'],
    incumbentsResponding: row['Incumbents Responding'],
    slug: generateTaskSlug(row['Task ID'], row['Task']),
    collection: 'Tasks',
    source: 'onet',
  }
}
```

## Import Process

1. **Download**: Fetch Task Statements.txt from O*NET
2. **Parse**: Parse TSV format (~20,000 rows)
3. **Transform**: Apply mapping logic
4. **Generate**: Create MDX files in db/Tasks/
5. **Validate**: Verify tasks link to valid occupations

## Expected Output

~20,000 MDX files in `db/Tasks/` directory:

```
db/Tasks/
├── readme.mdx (collection index)
├── analyze-user-needs-software-requirements/
│   └── readme.mdx
├── confer-with-systems-analysts-engineers/
│   └── readme.mdx
├── design-develop-computer-applications/
│   └── readme.mdx
└── ... (19,997 more tasks)
```

## Data Quality Checks

- ✅ All occupation codes reference valid occupations
- ✅ Task IDs are unique within each occupation
- ✅ Task statements are non-empty
- ✅ Task types are valid (Core/Supplemental)
- ✅ Incumbents Responding is 0-100%
