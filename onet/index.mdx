# O*NET Database

The **O*NET (Occupational Information Network)** database is America's primary source of occupational information, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Labor/Employment and Training Administration (USDOL/ETA).

## Overview

O*NET provides comprehensive data on 900+ occupations covering the U.S. economy, including:

- **Occupations**: Detailed occupation profiles with SOC codes
- **Tasks**: Work activities performed in each occupation
- **Skills**: Required skills and their importance levels
- **Abilities**: Enduring attributes and capacities
- **Knowledge**: Organized sets of principles and facts
- **Work Activities**: Types of work activities performed
- **Work Context**: Physical and social factors
- **Education & Training**: Required education and training
- **Wages & Employment**: Labor market information

## Data Structure

### O*NET-SOC Codes

Each occupation is identified by an 8-digit O*NET-SOC code:
- Format: `XX-XXXX.XX`
- Example: `15-1252.00` (Software Developers)

### Data Files

O*NET releases quarterly database exports containing TSV files:
- `Occupation Data.txt` - Occupation reference
- `Task Statements.txt` - Work tasks
- `Skills.txt` - Required skills
- `Abilities.txt` - Required abilities
- `Knowledge.txt` - Required knowledge
- `Work Activities.txt` - General work activities
- `Work Context.txt` - Work environment factors
- `Education, Training, and Experience.txt`
- `Wages.txt`

## Collections Generated

This source generates the following database collections:

1. **Occupations** (~900 entries)
   - Path: `db/Occupations/{slug}/readme.mdx`
   - Key: O*NET-SOC code
   - Contains: Title, description, alternate titles, tasks

2. **Tasks** (~20,000 entries)
   - Path: `db/Tasks/{slug}/readme.mdx`
   - Key: Task ID
   - Contains: Task statement, occupation references, importance

3. **Skills** (~35 skill types × 900 occupations)
   - Path: `db/Skills/{slug}/readme.mdx`
   - Key: Skill name
   - Contains: Definition, related occupations, importance levels

4. **Abilities** (~52 ability types × 900 occupations)
   - Path: `db/Abilities/{slug}/readme.mdx`
   - Key: Ability name
   - Contains: Definition, related occupations, importance levels

5. **Knowledge** (~33 knowledge types × 900 occupations)
   - Path: `db/Knowledge/{slug}/readme.mdx`
   - Key: Knowledge area
   - Contains: Description, related occupations, importance levels

## Import Strategy

### Download Schedule

- Quarterly database releases
- Automated download on release
- Version tracking in metadata

### ETL Pipeline

1. **Extract**: Download TSV files from O*NET database
2. **Transform**: Parse TSV, map to Thing types, generate slugs
3. **Load**: Write MDX files to db/collections/

### Incremental Updates

- Track last import version
- Only update changed entries
- Preserve manual edits in MDX frontmatter extensions

## Usage Examples

### Find Software Developer Information

```typescript
import { db } from '@mastra/core'

const occupation = await db.occupations.findOne({
  where: { code: '15-1252.00' }
})

const tasks = await db.tasks.findMany({
  where: { occupationCode: '15-1252.00' }
})
```

### Search by Skill

```typescript
const occupations = await db.occupations.findMany({
  where: {
    skills: { has: 'Programming' }
  }
})
```

## Data Quality

- **Authority**: Official U.S. government data
- **Coverage**: All major occupations in U.S. economy
- **Updates**: Quarterly revisions ensure currency
