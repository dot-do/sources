# O*NET Abilities Data Source

Abilities data describes enduring attributes of the individual that influence performance across various activities.

## Data Schema

### TSV Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| O*NET-SOC Code | string | Occupation code |
| Element ID | string | Ability element identifier (e.g., 1.A.1.a.1) |
| Element Name | string | Ability name |
| Scale ID | string | IM (Importance) or LV (Level) |
| Data Value | float | Rating value (1-7 scale) |
| N | integer | Sample size |
| Standard Error | float | Standard error of measurement |

### Example Rows

## Abilities Taxonomy

O*NET organizes 52 abilities into four categories:

### Cognitive Abilities (21)
- Verbal: Oral Comprehension, Written Comprehension, Oral Expression, Written Expression
- Idea Generation and Reasoning: Fluency of Ideas, Originality, Problem Sensitivity, Deductive Reasoning, Inductive Reasoning, Information Ordering, Category Flexibility
- Quantitative: Mathematical Reasoning, Number Facility
- Memory: Memorization
- Perceptual: Speed of Closure, Flexibility of Closure, Perceptual Speed
- Spatial: Spatial Orientation, Visualization
- Attentiveness: Selective Attention, Time Sharing

### Psychomotor Abilities (10)

## Collection Mapping

Maps to: **db/Abilities/{slug}/readme.mdx**

Each ability gets ONE collection entry aggregating all occupation relationships.

### Slug Generation

```typescript
// Example: "Oral Comprehension" → "oral-comprehension"
function generateAbilitySlug(abilityName: string): string {
  return abilityName
    .toLowerCase()
    .replace(/[^a-z0-9\s-]/g, '')
    .replace(/\s+/g, '-')
}
```

## Relationships

- **Belongs To**: Ability taxonomy (Cognitive/Psychomotor/Physical/Sensory)
- **Required By**: Multiple occupations (with importance and level ratings)
- **Related To**: Skills, knowledge areas, work activities

## Transform Logic

```typescript
interface AbilityRow {
  'O*NET-SOC Code': string
  'Element ID': string
  'Element Name': string
  'Scale ID': string // IM = Importance, LV = Level
  'Data Value': number
}

interface AbilityOccupation {
  code: string
  title: string
  importance: number // Scale ID = IM
  level: number      // Scale ID = LV
}

interface Ability {
  elementId: string
  name: string
  category: string
  subcategory: string
  description: string
  occupations: AbilityOccupation[]
  slug: string
  collection: 'Abilities'
  source: 'onet'
}

function aggregateAbilities(rows: AbilityRow[]): Ability[] {
  const abilitiesMap = new Map<string, Ability>()

  for (const row of rows) {
    const key = row['Element Name']
    if (!abilitiesMap.has(key)) {
      abilitiesMap.set(key, {
        elementId: row['Element ID'],
        name: row['Element Name'],
        category: categorizeAbility(row['Element ID']),
        subcategory: subcategorizeAbility(row['Element ID']),
        description: '', // Lookup from ability descriptions
        occupations: [],
        slug: generateAbilitySlug(row['Element Name']),
        collection: 'Abilities',
        source: 'onet',
      })
    }

    const ability = abilitiesMap.get(key)!
    let occupation = ability.occupations.find(o => o.code === row['O*NET-SOC Code'])

    if (!occupation) {
      occupation = {
        code: row['O*NET-SOC Code'],
        title: '', // Lookup from occupations
        importance: 0,
        level: 0,
      }
      ability.occupations.push(occupation)
    }

    if (row['Scale ID'] === 'IM') {
      occupation.importance = row['Data Value']
    } else if (row['Scale ID'] === 'LV') {
      occupation.level = row['Data Value']
    }
  }

  return Array.from(abilitiesMap.values())
}
```

## Import Process

1. **Download**: Fetch Abilities.txt from O*NET (~90,000 rows)
2. **Parse**: Parse TSV format
3. **Aggregate**: Group by ability name (52 unique abilities)
4. **Transform**: Collect all occupation relationships
5. **Generate**: Create 52 MDX files in db/Abilities/
6. **Validate**: Verify importance and level data

## Expected Output

~52 MDX files in `db/Abilities/` directory (one per unique ability):

```
db/Abilities/
├── readme.mdx (collection index)
├── oral-comprehension/
│   └── readme.mdx (lists all occupations with importance/level)
├── written-comprehension/
│   └── readme.mdx
├── deductive-reasoning/
│   └── readme.mdx
├── manual-dexterity/
│   └── readme.mdx
└── ... (48 more abilities)
```

## Data Quality Checks

- ✅ All ability names match O*NET taxonomy (52 abilities)
- ✅ Importance values are 1-7
- ✅ Level values are 1-7
- ✅ All occupation codes are valid
- ✅ Each ability has both IM and LV data
