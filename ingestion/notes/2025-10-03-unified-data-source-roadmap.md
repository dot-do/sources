|-------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Phase 1** | $65 (Cloudflare) | $0 (FREE data) | **$65** | $0.65 (100 customers) |
| **Phase 2** | $154 (+ DB, search) | $320 (NeverBounce, DataForSEO, Twitter) | **$474** | $0.95 (500 customers) |
| **Phase 3** | $354 (+ analytics) | $4,320 (+ Crunchbase, NewsAPI) | **$4,674** | $2.34 (2,000 customers) |
| **Phase 4** | $1,500 (enterprise) | $21,000 (enterprise data) | **$22,500** | $2.25 (10,000 customers) |

### Revenue Projections (Monthly)

| Phase | Customers | Avg. Price | MRR | COGS | Gross Margin |
|-------|-----------|------------|-----|------|--------------|
| **Phase 1 (Mo 3)** | 100 | $79 | $7,900 | $65 | **99.2%** |

- Reddit Ads (hyper-targeted subreddits)
- Twitter Ads (developer audience)
- Sponsorships (dev podcasts, newsletters)

### Launch Sequence

**Pre-Launch (Weeks 1-8):**
1. Build MVP APIs (Lead Enrichment, Technographics, Content Discovery)
2. Create landing page + docs
3. Beta program (50-100 users, gather feedback)
4. Build email list (500-1,000 signups)

**Launch Week:**

## Conclusion

We have **a clear path to $5M+ ARR** in Year 2 by building a suite of sales/marketing APIs that are:
- **70-95% cheaper** than incumbents
- **Superior data quality** (multi-source, real-time, high accuracy)
- **Better developer experience** (API-first, great docs, transparent pricing)

The data is **mostly FREE** (GitHub, WHOIS, Common Crawl, Reddit, etc.). Infrastructure is **dirt cheap** (Cloudflare). The real moat is **execution speed, data quality, and developer love**.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. **Validate demand** (50 customer interviews, landing page + Google Ads)
2. **Build Phase 1 MVP** (3 APIs in 6-8 weeks)
3. **Launch on Product Hunt + Hacker News** (aim for top 3 product)
4. **Gather feedback** (iterate fast based on real usage)
5. **Scale to Phase 2** (add premium data sources, more APIs)

**Timeline to $1M ARR:** 12-18 months
**Timeline to $5M ARR:** 24-30 months
**Timeline to $20M ARR:** 36-48 months

The opportunity is **massive**. The technology is **proven**. The data is **available**. Let's build. 🚀
