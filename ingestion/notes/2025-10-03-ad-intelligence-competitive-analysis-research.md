# Ad Intelligence & Competitive Analysis Research
## Building a Superior API to Compete with AdBeat, SimilarWeb, SpyFu & SEMrush

**Research Date:** 2025-10-03
**Purpose:** Identify data sources, methodologies, and implementation strategies for building a competitive ad intelligence API

---

## Executive Summary

The ad intelligence market is dominated by four major players: AdBeat ($249-699/mo), SimilarWeb ($167-449/mo), SpyFu ($39-299/mo), and SEMrush ($119.95-449.95/mo). Our research reveals significant opportunities to build a superior API-first platform by leveraging:

1. **Free public data sources** - Facebook Ad Library, TikTok Creative Center, LinkedIn Ad Library (combined coverage of billions of ads)
2. **Advanced scraping techniques** - SERP APIs, native ad monitoring, browser extension data aggregation
3. **Modern infrastructure** - Cloudflare R2 (zero egress), Playwright automation, perceptual hashing
4. **Legal frameworks** - hiQ v. LinkedIn precedent supports scraping public data
5. **API-first approach** - Competitors are dashboard-first; we can differentiate with superior developer experience

**Market Gap:** Current platforms are expensive, dashboard-centric, and lack comprehensive ad creative archives. An API-first platform with superior coverage, historical archives, and aggressive pricing ($49-249/mo) could capture significant market share.

**Implications:**

## 13. Legal & Compliance

### 13.1 Ad Scraping Legality (hiQ v. LinkedIn Precedent)

**hiQ Labs v. LinkedIn (2022) - Key Rulings:**

**Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA):**
- **Ninth Circuit (April 2022):** Scraping publicly available data does NOT violate CFAA
- "Publicly available computers" = no "unauthorized access"
- Cannot use CFAA to prevent third parties from scraping public data
- **Implication:** Ad scraping from public websites is legal under CFAA

**Breach of Contract:**
- **District Court (November 2022):** hiQ violated LinkedIn's user agreement
- Contract claims still viable even if CFAA doesn't apply
- Settlement: hiQ ceased scraping, deleted data, permanent injunction

**Key Takeaways for Ad Intelligence:**
1. ✅ **Legal:** Scraping publicly visible ads (no login required)
2. ⚠️ **Risky:** Creating fake accounts to access ads (contract violation)
3. ⚠️ **Risky:** Violating platform Terms of Service (breach of contract)
4. ✅ **Safe:** Using official APIs (Facebook Ad Library, TikTok Creative Center)
5. ✅ **Safe:** Browser extension with user consent (opt-in data collection)

**Best Practices:**
- Prioritize official APIs and free ad libraries
- Browser extensions: 100% opt-in, privacy policy, GDPR/CCPA compliant
- Public scraping: No login, respect robots.txt, rate limits
- Avoid: Fake accounts, automated logins, Terms of Service violations

### 13.2 Ad Library Usage Terms (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter)

**Facebook Ad Library:**
- **Free public access** (no account required for basic search)
- **API access:** Requires app approval, ID verification
- **Terms of Service:** Data usage for research, competitive analysis, transparency
- **Restrictions:** No automated bulk downloads without API, rate limits apply
- **Data Retention:** Ads stored for 7 years (political), shorter for commercial

**LinkedIn Ad Library:**
- **Free public access** (no account required)
- **No official API** (as of 2025)
- **Terms of Service:** Manual search allowed, automated scraping discouraged
- **Data Available:** All ads since June 2023, full creative, landing pages

**Twitter/X Ads Transparency:**
- **Free public access** (EU ads via DSA compliance)
- **Limited data:** CSV reports, no creative visuals
- **API:** No dedicated ad transparency API
- **Restrictions:** Advertiser handle search only, time range filters

**General Compliance:**
- Attribute data source (e.g., "Powered by Facebook Ad Library")
- Respect rate limits (avoid overloading servers)
- No resale of raw ad library data (add value, analysis)
- Comply with platform-specific usage policies

### 13.3 Trademark/Copyright (Storing Competitor Creatives)

**Copyright Considerations:**

**Fair Use Doctrine (US):**
- **Purpose:** Research, criticism, commentary, competitive analysis
- **Nature:** Factual vs. creative content (ads = commercial)
- **Amount:** Portion used vs. whole work
- **Market Effect:** Does it harm original work's market?

**Application to Ad Intelligence:**
- ✅ **Likely Fair Use:** Storing ads for competitive analysis, research, comparison
- ✅ **Transformative Use:** Providing analytics, insights, trends (not just displaying ads)
- ⚠️ **Gray Area:** Displaying full ad creatives without analysis
- ❌ **Not Fair Use:** Reselling raw ad creatives without transformation

**Trademark Considerations:**
- **Trademarked Logos:** Can be stored if sufficiently original (dual copyright/trademark)
- **Fair Use:** Allowed for descriptive purposes, competitive analysis, criticism
- **Not Infringement:** Using logos to identify source (e.g., "Ad by Nike")
- **Risky:** Using logos to imply endorsement, affiliation

**Best Practices:**
1. **Transformation:** Add value (analytics, insights, trends)
2. **Attribution:** Clearly state "Ad by [Brand]" or "Creative from [Campaign]"
3. **No Endorsement:** Disclaim affiliation with brands
4. **Low Resolution:** Store/display lower quality for analysis (not commercial reuse)
5. **Watermark:** Add watermark indicating "For competitive analysis only"

**DMCA Safe Harbor:**
- Designate DMCA agent (register with Copyright Office)
- Implement takedown procedure (respond to infringement claims within 24-48 hours)
- Display copyright policy on website

**2025 AI Considerations:**
- AI-generated ads: No copyright protection (US Copyright Office 2025 Report)
- Human-created ads: Full copyright protection applies

### 13.4 Privacy Compliance (Anonymized Browsing Data)

**GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation):**
- **Applies:** EU residents, regardless of company location
- **Requirements:**
  - Explicit user consent (opt-in)
  - Clear privacy policy
  - Right to access, rectification, erasure (GDPR Articles 15-17)
  - Data minimization (collect only necessary data)

  - Third-party sharing disclosure

**Browser Extension Specific:**
- **Chrome Web Store:** Privacy policy required, data handling disclosure
- **Firefox Add-ons:** Privacy policy required, permissions disclosure
- **Manifest V3:** Enhanced privacy protections, limited data access

**Best Practices for Anonymized Data:**
1. **No PII:** Strip names, emails, IP addresses, device IDs
2. **Aggregation:** Report data in aggregate (100+ users minimum)
3. **Opt-In Only:** 100% consent-based, no default tracking
4. **Clear Disclosure:** Privacy policy explains data use, sharing
5. **Data Retention:** Limit storage duration (30-90 days raw data)
6. **Third-Party Sharing:** Only with explicit consent
7. **Security:** Encryption at rest and in transit

**Anonymization Techniques:**
- IP address hashing (SHA-256)
- Device ID removal
- Cookie ID randomization
- Aggregation (never single-user reports)

### 13.5 Data Retention Policies

**Industry Standards:**
- **AdBeat:** 90 days (Standard), 1 year (Advanced)
- **SEMrush:** 1-2 years (depending on plan)
- **Google Ads:** 13 months (automatic deletion)

**Compliance:**

**Deletion Policy:**

- Automated deletion: 90 days for raw browsing data
- Opt-out: Immediate cessation of data collection, retroactive deletion upon request

**Data Lifecycle:**

3. **Storage** - Cloudflare R2, database (encrypted)
4. **Retention** - 3-5 years (ad data), 30-90 days (user data)
5. **Deletion** - Automated or upon request (audit trail)
